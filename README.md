## Can I skip the easy flags?

Absolutely! It’s really up to you. In a CTA event, there’s a prize for the winner that captures each of the flag first. So, you can either play it fast by going through what you’re familiar quickly (and competing with more people) or go for the harder flags that less people will be competing for.
