You can sign up by starring this repository.

(Yes, itâ€™s that easy ðŸ˜Š, thanks to the [star](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#star) API)

## Can I skip the easy flags?

Absolutely! Itâ€™s really up to you. In a CTA event, thereâ€™s a prize for the winner that captures each of the flag first. So, you can either play it fast by going through what youâ€™re familiar quickly (and competing with more people) or go for the harder flags that less people will be competing for.
